        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Itzel Rojas and Iâ€™m a current third year Business Administration student at the University of California Riverside.  Iâ€™m also a part time worker at the Student Recreation center under the Competitive Sports department. I got hired in March of 2019 and since then I have been a part of the National Intramural and Recreational Sports Association. Being a part of this association has allowed me to experience one of many educational and professional career opportunities.   <br><br>

        Over the summer of 2019, I was invented to attend NIRSAâ€™s California Workshop where I met many other student workers from other universities. The conference held multiple workshops that focused on developing skills and ideas to bring back to our campus. It was at the conference that I discovered my interest to work in a sports program facility in a college environment. In addition, I want to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in Business Administration or Recreational management. <br><br>
      Getting a masterâ€™s degree is a part of my goal from pursuing higher education and as a current member of TRIO Scholars Student Services I receive mentoring and guidance as in to how I can accomplish this goal. Through this program I have been able to visit many graduate school programs of my interest such as CSU Bakersfield MBA program. TRIO Scholars influenced me and sponsored many of my professional activities such to participate in Leadership conferences and other UCR educational and professional events.<br><br>
      Attending the UCR Womenâ€™s Leadership conference has been by far my best college experience. The leadership conference offered different workshops that intended to enrich young womenâ€™s minds. Throughout the event I was able to network with many notable UCR alumni such as Alisa Gmelich, the current Vice President of Marketing at IHOP Restaurants. After having a conversation with her and listening to her speech I was more than convinced that I wanted to become a part of the business community. <br><br>
